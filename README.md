## Welcome

*This is currently in development*

This is a website for one of Western Washington University's CSCI 436/536 Technology for Social Good class projects.
This is Group #4's "Healthy Eats" app, which started development Winter Quarter of 2021 with Dr. Shameem Ahmed.

### Background

#### What is the problem and why is it important? 

The problem we are addressing is improper dietary habits across the globe. Data from the World Health Organization show that 1.1 billion people don't get enough calories in their diet and another 1.1 billion get too many calories [1]. Lower-income households compared to households of higher income have lower quality, non-diverse diets. These lower-income households often take in fewer fruits and vegetables, and consume more sugar-sweetened drinks and highly processed foods, resulting in a lower quality diet which directly impacts their health and wellbeing.  

This is an important problem because there are many individuals globally who do not maintain a healthy and nutritious diet. For so many individuals or families who are living on a tight budget, buying healthy food simply isn’t considered. To many individuals, a healthier option can appear more expensive or it’s a challenge to know what recipes to use that fit within their budget. Other individuals tend to reach out to highly processed foods or sweetened beverages out of ease and budget.  

In 1987, 2.1 million Americans died, and it was later found that a poor diet was a primary cause of two-thirds of those who died[1]. Research also shows that diet is involved in one-third of cancers (digestive organs)[3]. As addressed previously, many individuals understand the importance of a healthy diet, but many don’t know where to start or are aware that they can still make healthy meals with a fixed budget. Fixing this problem would help to reduce the consumption of highly processed foods and sweet beverages and increase the household count of having nutritious and affordable meals. We want to give individuals a choice to get on track to a healthier diet, and also become a role model for their children in the importance of healthy meals.  


#### Who are the target users? Why should they care? 

Our target users are people who have access to mobile devices and aren’t currently consuming healthy nutritious meals; but specifically, we are targeting users who are interested in cooking quality meals within their budget, but are unsure of where to start learning. These users care about the problem because improper dietary habits can not only impact the individual in the long run but could potentially also affect their children’s dietary habits. By using our application, they can turn their eating habits around, potentially avoiding health issues down the road.

#### What is our solution? 

Our solution to this problem is to give users an application, Healthy Eats, which will generate healthy meals for themselves and their families based on their budget and the ingredients they already have. By having this application display this information, individuals and their families can benefit from a healthier diet, which in the long run can lead to a healthier life. We are planning to achieve SDG goal three, “Good Health and Wellbeing.” This goal will be achieved since we are directly impacting the user and their family in eating a healthier and nutritious meal. 

We developed our application using Android Studio, as it was one of the most easily accessible technologies for mobile development and allowed us to reach most mobile users due to the popularity of Android systems.

#### How is your solution different than the existing solutions?

The vast majority of similar solutions all have their best features locked behind a paywall. This came in the form of either a one-time purchase, or a monthly subscription charge. Considering that our target user is on a budget, we want to strive to create an app that is free-to-use with budgeting options at the forefront.

We also recognize that many of our users will be new to cooking their own food, and unlike the other solutions who assume a level of cooking expertise, we want to be able to cater to those with less cooking knowledge with our app. While other apps don’t have a way to show improvement in the cooking skills of the user, we hope to accomplish this by adding a leveling system, like other skills-based apps such as Duolingo, so that our users will feel a sense of accomplishment as they progress through each recipe.

### Research Methodology

#### Our Systematic Literature Review

In preperation for designing our first prototype of the app, our team conducted a brief literature review to try learn about what other reseachers have tested and what worked or didn't work.  

We reviewed 8 papers in total on the subject of promoting healthy eating via some ICT implementation or with specific constrains, such as a budget.  

Overall, we noticed a couple of main points that we wanted to address:
- Inequality in nutrition - Lower income houeholds tend to eat less healthy than higher income households due to time/money constraints
- Gamification is key - Providing incentives to eat healthier has shown fantastic results in changing targetted behavior and to keep users engaged with the ICT
- Everyone is different - healthy proposals promising a "one size fits all solution" are going to fail, plans need to be adjustable
- Knowledge is power - while strict budgets make healthy eating more difficult, it is possible with proper educational resources on the subject

After our literature review we knew that when designing our app we need it to be targetted towards lower-income households, and to provide them with basic education about how to succesfully eat healthy on a budget. We also needed to find a way to keep our users engaged and coming back to the app, so some form of gamification elements should be included.
